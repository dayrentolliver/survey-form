### How it works:
1. Open the survey form: https://dayrentolliver.github.io/survey-form/
2. Enter your first and last name
3. Enter your email address
4. Enter your age (between 18 - 100 years old)
5. Tell us how you heard about our non-profit
6. Select one or more projects that you are interested in
7. Select one or more days that you are able to volunteer
8. Select your preferred method of contact
9. Optionally, tell us more about yourself
10. Submit the form

### Things I learned:
* How to create a form
* How to require specific fields
* How to perform email validation
* How to create an age range
* How to create checkboxes, radio buttons and textareas
* How to pre-check specific checkboxes
* How to create a Submit button

### Future Features
* Incorporate JavaScript to require that the questions: 'What project(s) are you interested in?' and 'What days are you available to volunteer?' are checked before being able to submit
